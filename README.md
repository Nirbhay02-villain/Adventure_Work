# Adventure_Work
A Microsoft Power BI business intelligence dashboard for AdventureWorks, a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.

This data was derived from the [AdventureWorks sample databases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure) available from Microsoft.

The customer base is spread across 6 countries on 3 continents: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom and United States. Sales and return data is available for the period between 01/01/2020 and 30/06/2022. Customer profiles include date of birth, annual income, education level, number of children, occupation and homeowner status.

There is an appreciable dip in revenue between 01/06/2020 and 01/11/2020 (possibly due to the simulated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), after which revenue appears to grow linearly.

Was this due to a highly successful seasonal campaign, e.g. a Black Friday promotion?

- Understandably, tires and tubes are the most ordered product type, while cycling shorts are the most returned product type. After mountain bike fenders, sports helmets top the list of revenue-generating products, despite having relatively high return rates:
